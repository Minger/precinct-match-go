# precinct-match-go
Voter File Matching experiment in Go using Itertools

This project is based on a [Python project](https://github.com/turnerd/precinct-match) The motivation is to play with the [Go Itertools Package](https://github.com/yanatan16/itertools) The focus is more on learning itertools, so weak matching, copying data from source file have not been implemented.
